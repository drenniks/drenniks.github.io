  I am currently investigating nucleosynthesis from neutron star mergers (NSM) in the very early universe. A portion of the first generation of stars (Population III, Pop III) that form in the universe will end up exploding in a supernova, and the remnant will fall back to become a neutron star (NS). Some of these NSs will pair up with another NS, destined to dance with one another until they merge together. This extreme event is thought to provide an environment to create r-process elements. These elements are produced via the rapid process where neutrons are bombarded onto an atom to build up heavier elements. About half of the elements heavier than iron are thought to be produced by the r-process, making this process extremely important to understand if we want to piece together the origin of the periodic table.

  Using high resolution cosmological simulations, I am studying the r-process enrichment produced by a NSM in the early universe. To investigate this, I am studying a progenitor halo of an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy in a zoom-in simulation. I strategically chose this halo from a 4 Mpc$^{3}$ comoving box with a 512$^{3}$ base grid resolution by considering the distance to nearby halos, the virial ratio, and the mass of the halo (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03967.pdf"><font color="#0000ff"></font>"Safarzadeh et al. 2018"</font></a>). I am re-running this halo at higher resolutions, with one, two, and three more nested grids. Upon completion, I will chose a Pop III star to become the NS binary system. I have added a NSM model to the Enzo simulation code, where a single Pop III star will be converted to a symmetric Pop III binary system (still modelled as a single particle). After their lifetime, they will both explode in a supernova and the particle will change to a NS binary system. At this point, three parameters (NSM explosion energy, time delay, and total r-process ejecta mass) will be varied to see how they effect r-process enrichment and the next generation of star formation. The chosen parameters can be seen in the table below, where each row corresponds to a different simulation. I will be using Reticulum 2 as a case study, since this UFD galaxy has been found to contain r-process enhanced stars (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17425"><font color="#0000ff"></font>"Ji. et al. 2016"</font></a>). This work has been funded by the Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology award beginning in August of 2020.

  As of June 2022, simulations are still running and I am in the process of creating an analysis pipeline. I have run my model on a test simulation to ensure that my model is working correctly. In the first example movie below, we see how the host halo evolves with time, centered on the NS binary particle (white x). The black x's indicate Pop II stars. The title of the plot indicates what stage the particle is in, either a Pop III binary, a NS binary or a dark matter particle. When the NS binary particle "merges", we see a burst of color, corresponding to the field of metals produced by the NSM. For comparison, on the bottom we see the evolution of the density field centered on the NS binary particle.

  <h1>Past Research Projects</h1>
  <h3>Georgia Tech</h3>
  In January of 2020, I published my first paper, titled <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/3/4386/5707420"><font color="#0000ff"></font>"Cradles of the first stars: self-shielding, halo masses, and multiplicity"</font></a> in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. This paper focused on the birthplaces of the first stars, where we tried to uncover what types of halos form Population III stars in the presence of a Lyman-Werner (LW) background using cosmological simulations run with Enzo. We found that halos can form Pop III stars at lower masses compared to previous work, thanks to H2 self-shielding. We also found that halos are more likely to form multiple Pop III stars, with a median number of four, up to a maximum of 16, at the instance of Pop III star formation. We find no correlation between average LW background and host halo mass at the instance of star formation, implying that LW radiation feedback may not affect Pop III star formation as much as previously thought. This can be seen in the figure below.

  Here we have the average LW radiation within a host halo plotted against the host halo mass for every Pop III star that forms in the simulation, colored by the redshift of formation. The black line shows the minimum mass threshold from Machacek et al. (2001). We see most of our halos form Pop III stars below the minimum mass threshold, thanks to H2 self-shielding. There are a few halos that can form multiple Pop III stars in the presence of a high LW background, although this only occurs when there are neighboring halos forming stars at about the same time. When this happens, the LW radiation coming from one neighbor halo doesn't have enough time to dissociate H2 in the second neighbor halo. 

  <h3>University of Washington</h3>
  While at the University of Washington, I was investigating dust attenuation at high redshifts. Using the <a href="https://mtremmel.github.io/research/romulus.html"><font color="#0000ff">Romulus simulations</font></a> and a post-processing radiative transfer code called <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/root/index.html"><font color="#0000ff">SKIRT</font></a>, I was able to simulate radiative transfer in galaxies to look at the IRX-&beta relationship. This relationship is used to infer star-formation at high redshifts, yet the relationship is calibrated to local galaxies. I was investigating whether or not this was a good assumption to make, and if not, what would a better fit be for high redshift galaxies.

  SKIRT is a great tool for generating beautiful images of galaxies. There are a few examples below, of galaxies at a redshift of 0, plotted in RGB color.
