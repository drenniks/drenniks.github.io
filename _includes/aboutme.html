        About Me
    </h1>

    Hello! My name is Danielle Ruth Skinner and I'm a PhD Candidate in the <a href="http://cosmo.gatech.edu/"><font color="#0000ff">Computational Cosmology Group</font></a> led by Dr. John Wise at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am interested in galaxy evolution and formation, the first stars in the universe, and matching observations with cosmological simulations.

    Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelor of Science from the University of Washington with a double major in physics and astronomy and a double minor in mathematics and philosophy. While at UW, I was a student assistant in the Telescope Engineering Lab, which worked primarily for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

    While I am not analyzing cosmological simulations, I get to spend time at home with my two kitties, Hobbes and Leto. I also enjoy my fair share of playing video games and knitting. I am currently learning how to handstand and practice contortion!

    In January of 2020, I dedicated myself to a vegan lifestyle, and have been fully committed ever since. I am very passionate about animal rights and the environmental impact that animal agriculture has on the earth and the communities that live around these factories. I highly encourage everyone to at least reduce, if not fully eliminate, their meat/animal product intake, and am more than happy to answer any questions you may have about making this change.
